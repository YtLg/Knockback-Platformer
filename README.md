# Knockback-Platformer
Using the ideas I've built from a test project I want to try and implement them in a platformer setting

# Initial To-Do
- [] Create sprites for player, hazards and environment
- [] Create player movement, and implement the knockback mechanic.
- [] Create Level 1.

# Potential Features
- [] Create an additional level
- [] Create an enemy
- [] Implement an extra mechanic to add gamplay depth and difficulty.
